# myownwebsite
The purpose of my website is to mainly provided knowledge to the public to show them that there are still a large amount of invisible and absent data with the system.
The data set specifically targeted to women, where topics are discussioned showing each and every importance of the data itself and the visibility. 
An underlying audience is the companies and organizations that owns the datasets and chooses not to report it to the public.

There are certain issues that I am currently working on like for one of the pages, two of the buttons is not working. I am still finding out the underlying issues that is causing it to happen (ps. you have to place your cursor to the very left to click the buttons). Furthermore, the website is not yet usable for various technologies, for now computer & ipad (the layout will be distorted with different screen sizes).
