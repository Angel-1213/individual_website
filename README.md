There are certain issues that I am currently working on like for one of the pages, two of the buttons is not working. I am still finding out the underlying issues that is causing it to happen
(ps. you have to place your cursor to the very left to click the buttons). Furthermore, the website is not yet usable for various technologies, for now computer & ipad (the layout will be distorted
with different screen sizes).
