        <p id="transportation-text">In the present days, especially at night, women are being targeted as the victim
            of being treated violently by men. The more stunning fact is that, several harrassments and assults are
            collected to the database but not reported to the public. As a result, this phenomenon increases women's
            risks of experiencing danger on roads. </p><br />

        <p id="difference-text">In the previous section we have explored how danger experienced by women are being
            unreported in specific cities. Now, if we employ those data and compare with men, the difference is
            <i>stark</i>.
            As you see beneath, there is the outline of a bar graph. As a matter of fact, the tall blue
            bars
            shown are sectors to the risks that is faced by <b>women</b>! Both women and men have the highest fear on
            walking
            in multistorey car parks. And yet, the probability of women scared of crime is <u>exactly 2 times</u>
            more
            than men: <b>31% TO 62%!</b> The finding pinpoints particularly <a

                be more unreported data flowing in collection of statistics.
