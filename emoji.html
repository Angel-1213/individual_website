        <p class="emoji-text"><b>78% of emoji users are women</b>. In
            fact, emojis have became one of the most popular ways of communication in the present day, they express
            feelings, attitudes and <a href="http://unicode.org/L2/L2016/16160-emoji-professions.pdf"
                class="paper-links">lifestyles</a>.
        </p>
        <p class="emoji-text">Surprisingly, Unicode's creation on defult is gender-neutral, meaning that they do not
            specify this emoji into a certain gender. The table of <a
                href="https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr51/proposed.html" class="paper-links">"Emoji with
                Explicit Gender Appearance"</a> illustrates emojis that are linked into specific genders.
            From the table, the emojis are seperated into gender of male and female. Each of these labels are
            appearance based on age, situation and profession.

        <p> However, an update from an explict representation to gender-neutral emojis
            reveals a shocking truth. The change of the gender into genderless emojis manifests that <b>only 1 out of 4
                appearances</b> showcase the gender as <i>'women'</i>. In addition of the reciprocated data, the
            disparity highlights the oversight of women's data into the emoji system --they are assuming that
            <u>gender-neutral equals to 'men', whereas women can be only seen as the exclusives</u>.

        <p>The standarization for emojis have been improved a lot during the last few years,
            there
