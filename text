The purpose of my website is to mainly provided knowledge to the public to show them that there are still a large amount of invisible and absent data with the system.
The data set specifically targeted to women, where topics are discussioned showing each and every importance of the data itself and the visibility of women. 
An underlying audience is the companies and organizations that owns the datasets and chooses not to report it to the public.
